# Tezos Statz Demo

![](docs/ui.png)

A small WIP demonstration app written in [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) that allows to view [Tezos](https://tezos.com/) blockchain data.
On Android / iOS it includes a QR code scanner to scan the Tezos address. The web version doesn't have this feature.

Tezos Statz Demo calls the TzStats REST API provided by https://blockwatch.cc/

The API is documented here: https://tzstats.com/docs/api

The code is published under the Apache license. Not affiliated with TzStats.
