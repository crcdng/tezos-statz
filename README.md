# Tezos Statz Demo

![](docs/ui.png)

A small WIP demonstration app written in [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) that allows to view [Tezos](https://tezos.com/) blockchain data.
On Android / iOS it includes a QR code scanner to scan the Tezos address. The web version doesn't have this feature.

Tezos Statz Demo calls the TzStats REST API provided by https://blockwatch.cc/

The API is documented here: https://tzstats.com/docs/api

The code is published under the Apache license. Not affiliated with TzStats. 

## How to run

Get Flutter:
https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install

Run in the browser:
`flutter run -d chrome`

To deploy on a mobile device, run:

```
flutter create .
```

Before deploying to iOS, you need to edit `iOS/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following key:

```
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app uses the camera to scan QR codes of Tezos addresses.</string>
```

Then run:

```
flutter run -d <your Android device>
flutter run -d <your iOS device>
```
