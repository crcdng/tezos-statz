# Tezos Statz Demo

This is a small WIP demonstration app written in [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) that allows to view Tezos blockchain data.
On Android / iOS it includes a QR code scanner to scan the address. This web demo does not.

Tezos Statz Demo calls the TzStats REST API provided by https://blockwatch.cc/

The API is documented here: https://tzstats.com/docs/api

The app is published under the Apache license. Not affiliated with TzStats.
